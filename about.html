                <p>A nice experience away form the busy daily life. The wooden cottage itself gives more rest to eyes
                    and for those who want to enjoy the hotel there is pool, bar and wood scrappings to peak your
                    inteset. The service in the hotel and bar is great too. Definitely a go to place in your check list.
